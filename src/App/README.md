Folders represent the component nesting tree. The root component is `Index`. Its
descendants, such as `Explorer`, are nested inside of `Index/` folder.
Descendants of `Explorer` are inside `Explorer/` and so on.

One exception is the `components/` folder, which has re-usable components that
appear in multiple descendants.
